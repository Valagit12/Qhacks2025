# LUNA

LUNA is an assistive wearable that helps blind and low-vision individuals understand their surroundings in real time using AI-powered image-to-speech technology. By combining a discreet glasses-mounted camera with natural language feedback, LUNA empowers users to move through the world more confidently and independently.
